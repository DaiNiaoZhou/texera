Omar al-Bashir says South Sudan not ready for split
Sudan President Omar al-Bashir has warned that Southern Sudan will face instability if it votes to secede from the north in the upcoming referendum.He told al-Jazeera TV the south did not have the ability to create a stable state or provide for its citizens.Correspondents say the comments will infuriate the SPLM - former rebels who have ruled the south since the two-decades-long civil war ended in 2005.Later, an attack by gunmen on Southern Sudan's military left four people dead.Col Philip Aguer, a military spokesman, told the Associated Press that forces loyal to rebel leader Gatluak Gai had attacked forces in the Sudan People's Liberation Army overnight in the oil-rich area of Unity state.He said the SPLA troops had retaliated and killed four of the rebels.UN officials confirmed that they had received reports of an attack in the area, but did not say which side had suffered the fatalities.Correspondents expect an overwhelming "yes" vote in the referendum, which would see the world's newest country come into being.The poll, which begins on Sunday, was part of the terms of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which ended the civil war.In an interview with the Arabic news channel al-Jazeera, Mr Bashir said he understood why many southerners wanted independence, but he expressed concern at how the new nation would cope."The south suffers from many problems," he said."It's been at war since 1959. The south does not have the ability to provide for its citizens or create a state or authority."Mr Bashir said southerners living in the north would not be allowed dual citizenship, and floated the idea of the two nations joining in an EU-style bloc.He also raised the issue of Abyei, an oil-rich region with disputed borders.He warned that if southerners seized the region for themselves, it could lead to war.Analysts say Mr Bashir is under intense pressure from northern politicians, who fear that secession of the south may lead to a further splintering of the country.North and south Sudan have suffered decades of infighting in conflicts driven by religious and ethnic divides.Southerners have long complained of mistreatment at the hands of the Khartoum government.At an event on Friday, former South African President Thabo Mbeki - the African Union's mediator on Sudan - said the vote marks the "true emancipation" of the people of the south."The work of freedom is just at its beginning. We are confident that the southern Sudanese people have the strength and spirit to succeed in that endeavour," he told a large crowd in Juba, the south's capital.Southern Sudanese will have a week to cast their vote on the future of the region, one of the least developed areas in the world.Turnout will be important because the CPA stipulates a quorum of 60% of the 3.8 million registered voters.
