French mansion locked for 100 years, opens to public
A mansion house in central France that was kept locked up for 100 years has just been opened to the public, in accordance with its owner's last wishes. Louis Mantin, a wealthy gentleman from the town of Moulins, stipulated in his will that his house should be turned into a museum a century after his death. Hugh Schofield reports.
