Newspaper review: Andy Coulson resignation scrutinised
The resignation of No 10's director of communications Andy Coulson fills many of the front pages of the newspapers.For the Times, his decision is "the most serious blow to the government since the coalition came to power".The Daily Mirror's Kevin Maguire thinks David Cameron will miss his media man, arguing he had proved his worth by persuading the PM to drop his personal photographer from the public payroll.Abandoning holiday plans in the cold snap was also a good call, it says.The Independent's Steve Richards believes Mr Coulson made "big errors".He cites the "historic misjudgement" of the television debates during the general election as an example.Meanwhile, the Guardian claims the resignation leaves "too many unanswered questions about too many important people, companies and institutions".The paper is also unhappy with the Metropolitan Police's handling of the News of the World investigation that prompted Andy Coulson's resignation, saying it has been "stubbornly uncooperative".Tony Blair's four-hour grilling by Sir John Chilcot's Iraq war inquiry features prominently in most of the papers.The Sun says he showed regret for the first time since the war began but "again stopped short of an apology".It also reports his warning to the West to "stand as firm against Iran as he did with Saddam Hussein's Iraq". Meanwhile, the Daily Mail focuses on the "fury of families" saying tearful relatives at the inquiry shouted it is too late while others left in disgust.In other news, the Daily Telegraph says its research shows pay packets of university vice-chancellors rose by up to 20% last year, as student tuition fees are set to triple.The National Union of Students brands the findings "disgusting".Finally, the Times says Paddington Bear can rest assured because UK consumers have not ditched marmalade after all.Reports of a decline in sales can be explained by a growing number of people making their own, it says.
