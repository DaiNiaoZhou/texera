The picture emerging from French media reports is that the three suspended executives may have leaked details of battery and engine technologies developed for Renault's new generation of electric cars. Whether or not the allegations are true, they have touched a raw nerve. Western firms are worried about rivals in emerging economies grabbing their best ideas without paying for them.   The issue is becoming more serious as China and other new industrial powers become more sophisticated in what they produce.   Stories about stolen industrial secrets will probably become more frequent as competition between old industrial powers and new ones intensifies.

One of the biggest advantages that Western carmakers have is their advanced technology, which enables them to compete against cheaper labour costs outside Europe.
