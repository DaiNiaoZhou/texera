Staff strike over pupil violence at Lanchester School
A special school in the West Midlands has closed after staff went on strike in protest at violence from pupils.Teachers and other staff at Lanchester School, Castle Bromwich, said they were taking action to highlight and protect students and staff against attacks.The NUT and GMB unions said there had been 62 incidents since September where pupils had been restrained as a result of violent or threatening behaviour.Solihull Council said it was disappointed at the strike action.It said that "vulnerable children" were having their education disrupted and the safety of staff and pupils was of paramount importance.A GMB spokesman said examples of violence included staff being repeatedly kicked, punched in the face and arm and being threatened.The council confirmed there had been assaults on staff but said none had required first aid.It said incidents which required pupils to be restrained were not uncommon at schools of this type.Teacher and GMB shop steward Martin Nash said it was true what the council said about no-one requiring first aid but he had treatment after getting an injury in the playground.He said he had been injured on 13 October 2010 and reported to the executive principal and the school's first aiders."They came to see but there was nothing they could do. I saw my doctor the next day," he said.
