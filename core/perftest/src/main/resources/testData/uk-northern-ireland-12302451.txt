Baggott says Belfast bombers akin to Omagh killers
Northern Ireland's chief constable Matt Baggott has likened those responsible for planting explosives on the Antrim Road in north Belfast to the Omagh bombers.Police have confirmed that a second viable device, designed to kill, was made safe on Thursday afternoon.It was found behind a scout hall.The Antrim Road was reopened on Thursday evening and everyone who had been moved from their homes had been allowed to return.It is understood some businesses will still be affected on Friday.On Wednesday, police said a bomb found outside a shop earlier this week was an "anti-personnel device" designed to kill people.  At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Baggott said those behind the attacks "had the same recklessness and the same mindset as those that brought about the Omagh tragedy"."There were hundreds of people who could have been very badly hurt and killed by this device in a busy residential area, where we have children, where we have people going about their normal business," he added."People who simply want to get on with their job."Mr Baggott said there would be a "relentless pursuit" of those responsible for the devices.Chief Superintendent Mark Hamilton said that the second device had been discovered on Thursday."That alone shows there was an absolute need to proceed very carefully and very cautiously through this incident to ensure that no life was lost," he said."I would like to commend the army technical officers for their bravery in a very difficult operating environment."About 50 families spent a second night out of their homes on Wednesday. Chief Supt Hamilton said making sure the area was safe was a "slow, methodical, painstaking process"."There's been people in this community who have deliberately planted a bomb in this area and their only purpose was to murder people," he added."Then you add to that the recklessness of leaving a device in an unstable condition which could have exploded."Chief Supt Hamilton said police officers had been called to an Xtravision shop on Sunday night.He said the intention of the bombers had been to kill three police officers lured to the scene."The first call we got was on Monday afternoon and it was some 24 hours later before we got sufficient information to bring us to the Xtravision, to try and go forward and search for this bomb and make it safe."The alert, which is close to Antrim Road police station, began after a series of calls claiming to be from dissident republican group Oglaigh na hEireann.
