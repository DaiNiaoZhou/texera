Driver's near miss with out of control lorry
A driver in Canada with a camera on his dashboard captured the moment he came within inches of being struck by an out of control lorry. Matthew Krizsan was driving along a road in Ontario when a truck going the other way came crashing through the central reservation. He managed to swerve out of the lorry's path just in time. No one was badly hurt in the accident.
