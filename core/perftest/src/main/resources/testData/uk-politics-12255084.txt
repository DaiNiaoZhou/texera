Deidre Gover: Tony Blair's regret comments 'too late'
A mother who lost her son in Iraq said she felt Tony Blair's comments to the Iraq inquiry that he "regretted deeply and profoundly the loss of life" felt "rehearsed".Speaking after the former prime minister's second appearance at the inquiry, Deidre Gover said she had to "turn away" as he made the statement and said the words came "too late" for the families whose relatives were killed in Iraq.
