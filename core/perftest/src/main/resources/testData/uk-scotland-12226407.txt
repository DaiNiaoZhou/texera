MSPs challenge Scots budget plans
The Scottish government has been urged to explain how its budget plans will meet its top priority of boosting economic growth.Holyrood's finance committee said ministers must answer concern that the £33bn spending proposals for 2011-12 focus on shielding the public sector.The committee has been examining the budget, before it faces its first parliamentary vote next week.Treasury spending cuts have resulted in a £1bn reduction in the Scots budget.Speaking as the finance committee published a report on the budget, its convener, SNP MSP Andrew Welsh, said: "The finance committee recognises in its report that this is the most difficult budget since devolution, and that producing a balanced budget in these circumstances will be a highly significant challenge for both the government and the parliament."In our report, we have scrutinised the draft budget by assessing the extent to which the government's priorities contribute to its core purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth."We have asked the government to respond to the view of a number of witnesses that the government's priority is the protection of public services and not economic growth."The committee made several recommendations in its report, including:The finance committee's report criticised plans by Finance Secretary John Swinney to raise £30m through levying extra rates on the largest retailers.That measure is expected to be voted down by MSPs - although the minister is challenging his rivals to spell out other ways of raising revenue or cutting spending.But the finance committee supported government plans to continue the council tax freeze.

The clear point has been made that the budget doesn't meet the needs of the economy.''The SNP's Joe Fitzpatrick, who is a member of the parliament's finance committee, said: "John Swinney and the SNP have put forward a balanced budget for Scotland that spares our pensioners and families from council tax rises in order to help household budgets and redresses the balance for business with a small levy on supermarkets.''
